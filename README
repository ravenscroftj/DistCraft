DISTCRAFT - Distributed Game Engine
-------------------------------------

Distcraft is a distributed MMO engine written primarily in Python (C/C++ 
development is planned once a working pythonic implementation has been
created).

It is experimental and is currently only an engine, not a fully fledged game.
